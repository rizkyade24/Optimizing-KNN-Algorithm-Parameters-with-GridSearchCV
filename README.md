# Optimizing-KNN-Algorithm-Parameters-with-GridSearchCV

Grid Search Cross Validation is a method of selecting a combination of models and hyperparameters by testing the combinations one by one and validating each combination. The goal is to determine the combination that produces the best model performance that can be selected to be used as a model for prediction.

Before tuning parameters using GridSearchCV
